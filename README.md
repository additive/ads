## Installation

```bash
$ npm install @additive/ads
```

## Usage

We have two packages; _ads_ and _adsm_. **ADSM** is smaller and just includes
some important parts, like the bootstrap grid, see more in
[scss/adsm.scss](scss/adsm.scss). **ADS** includes components and styles plus
the **ADSM** package.

To use one of them. Just import them via SCSS or load the CSS directly into your
page.

```scss
@import '@additive/ads/scss/ads';
@import '@additive/ads/scss/adsm'; // minimal
```
